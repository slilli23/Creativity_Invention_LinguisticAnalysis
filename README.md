# Creativity, Invention and Linguistic Analysis. A case Study.


## Overview

This repository contains the files and code used in the analytical study of Giovanni Testori's creative literary language.

The purpose of this study is to examine the linguistic inventions of Giovanni Testori (1923–1993), a 20th-century Italian author. Testori’s works challenge standard linguistic frameworks by merging Italian, Milanese dialect, word deformations, and code-mixing across various stylistic levels. This research designs an alternative approach to close reading and sampling, applying automated text analysis tools to quantitatively describe the deviations from standard language.
